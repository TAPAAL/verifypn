This PR adds interactive mode which uses the explicit colored engine to generate valid transition-binding pairs. This makes it possible to repeatedly send transitions and then receiving successors and possible bindings.

The protocol is as follows:

    When verifypn is called by ./verifypn-linux64 <model-path> -n 0 -C --interactive-mode it reads an xml encoded marking from the stdin followed by three newlines.
    A list of valid transition-binding pairs is printed to the stdout followed by three newlines
    Now either a transition or new marking can be written to stdin followd by three newlines
    a. If a transition-binding pair was given, the result marking of firing that transition-binding pair is written followed by three new lines
    Goes back to step 2

An example of this can be seen here where # means something is written to stdin and no prefix means something is received from stdout. The corresponding PNML encoded net for this example is test-interactive-mode.txt as a .txt file because github is not happy with the .pnml extension
